synopsis: Fast, accurate CommonMark (Markdown) parser and renderer
description:
    This package provides Haskell bindings for
    <https://github.com/jgm/cmark libcmark>, the reference
    parser for <http://commonmark.org CommonMark>, a fully
    specified variant of Markdown. It includes sources for
    libcmark (0.20.0) and does not require prior installation of the
    C library.
    .
    cmark provides the following advantages over existing
    Markdown libraries for Haskell:
    .
    -   Speed: Conversion speed is on par with the
    <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sundown sundown>
    library. We were unable to measure precisely
    against
    <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sundown sundown>,
    which raised a malloc error when compiled into our
    benchmark suite. Relative to other implementations:
    cmark was 82 times faster than
    <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cheapskate cheapskate>,
    59 times faster than
    <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/markdown markdown>,
    105 times faster than
    <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc pandoc>,
    and 2.8 times faster than
    <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/discount discount>.
    .
    -   Memory footprint: Memory footprint is on par with
    <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sundown sundown>.
    On one sample, the library uses a fourth the memory that
    <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/markdown markdown>
    uses, and less than a tenth the memory that
    <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc pandoc>
    uses.
    .
    -   Robustness: cmark can handle whatever is thrown
    at it, without the exponential blowups in parsing
    time one can sometimes get with other libraries.
    (The input @bench\/full-sample.md@, for example,
    causes both
    <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc pandoc>
    and
    <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/markdown markdown>
    to grind to a halt.)
    .
    -   Accuracy: cmark passes the CommonMark spec\'s
    suite of over 500 conformance tests.
    .
    -   Standardization: Since there is a spec and a
    comprehensive suite of tests, we can have a high
    degree of confidence that any two CommonMark
    implementations will behave the same. Thus, for
    example, one could use this library for server-side
    rendering and
    <http://github.com/jgm/commonmark.js commonmark.js>
    for client-side previewing.
    .
    -   Ease of installation: cmark is portable and has
    minimal dependencies.
    .
    cmark does not provide Haskell versions of the whole
    <http://github.com/jgm/cmark libcmark> API, which is
    built around mutable @cmark_node@ objects. Instead, it
    provides functions for converting CommonMark to HTML
    (and other formats), and a function for converting
    CommonMark to a @Node@ tree that can be processed
    further using Haskell.
    .
    A note on security: This library does not attempt
    to sanitize HTML output. We recommend using
    <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xss-sanitize xss-sanitize>
    to filter the output.
    .
    A note on stability: There is a good chance the API
    will change significantly after this early release.
